what it does is that first it captrues the video and then finds the region of interest 
and in the region og interest it converts all the bgr colors into hsv colors

define the range of skin color in hsv the upper and the lower range
then extract the skin colour into possibly two colors 
white - skin
black - rest
 
for removing noise we wil blur the 

we will use contours 
contours  are basically outlines being shown in the region of interest

we remove noise by increasing the max contour area

\\\\\
basis of project

convex hull is defined 
and we calculate the area of convex hull 

and we also calculate the area of my hand

then calc the area ratio 

area_ratio = ((areahull - areahand)/areahand)*100


the basis suggests that this area ratio would be different for each of the gestures


then we define defects 
defects are the regions not covered by the hand in the convex hull
